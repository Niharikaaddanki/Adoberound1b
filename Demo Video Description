🎥 Demo Video Description: Adobe Hackathon Round 1B
This screen recording demonstrates the functionality of my solution for Round 1B of the Adobe "Connecting the Dots" Hackathon. The application is designed to intelligently identify and rank the most relevant sections from a collection of PDF documents, tailored to a given persona and job-to-be-done.

📌 Key Highlights in the Video:
📂 PDF Collection & Interface
The user uploads multiple PDF documents through the Streamlit interface.

All PDFs are processed entirely offline, ensuring full compatibility with Adobe’s runtime constraints.

👤 Persona & Task Selection
The user selects “Challenge 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence.”

A persona (e.g., Investment Analyst) is chosen from a dropdown.

A job-to-be-done is entered (e.g., Analyze revenue trends and R&D investments).

🔍 Intelligent Section Extraction
The system automatically analyzes the structure of all uploaded PDFs.

It performs keyword-based matching between section headings and the task input.

Each section is scored for relevance and ranked accordingly.

🧾 Output JSON Preview
The app displays the generated JSON output, including:

Metadata (documents, persona, task, timestamp)

Extracted sections with page numbers and ranked relevance

Subsection placeholders (stub text for refinement)

💾 JSON Download Option
Users can download the JSON output directly from the interface.

Output format is fully aligned with the Adobe Round 1B schema.

⚙ Performance
The processing is fast and efficient (well under the 60-second limit for 3–5 PDFs).

No API calls or external services are used — the entire pipeline is offline and CPU-only.

💡 Technologies Used
pdfminer.six – for layout-aware PDF parsing and heading extraction

Streamlit – for interactive UI and visualization

Custom heuristics – for keyword-based relevance ranking of document sections

Standard Python libraries – including re, datetime, and json
